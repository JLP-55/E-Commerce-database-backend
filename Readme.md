# Description 

**The goal of this project was to build the back end of an e-commerce website, by modifying pre-existing code, with the aim of providing a business with the means of storing large amounts of data and information, so that they can compete with ather e-commerce companies.**

### Usage
---
>You will need to install all required dependancies using `npm i`<br>
>To test, you will need to create the database and seed it with relevant information.<br>
>This can be done by running the `SOURCE schema.sql;` command from the correct file location in mysql, and then running the command `node ./seeds/index.js` to seed the database with information.<br>
>Run `npm run start` in your terminal to start the server.<br>
>Using your browser or an API client such as insomnia or postman, you can view the response for each of the three routes, these being categories, products or tags, all of which are located on the route path `http://localhost:3001/api`.<br>
>Additionally, you can view any of these requests by an individual `:id`.<br>
